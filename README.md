## 1) Scope

This Policy applies to our LinkedIn posting and management services and any related tools we provide. It does not cover third‑party websites or services that we do not control.

---

## 2) Information We Collect

- **LinkedIn account data** you authorize via LinkedIn OAuth (e.g., member ID, name, profile information permitted by the scopes you grant, and access tokens).
- **Content you provide** (e.g., text, images, media, scheduling instructions) for posting on LinkedIn.
- **Page and post metadata** (e.g., LinkedIn Page ID, post IDs/URLs, timestamps, status, limited performance metrics if available under granted scopes).
- **Operational logs and diagnostics** (e.g., event timestamps, error logs) to maintain and improve our services.

We do **not** intentionally collect sensitive categories of data unless you include such content in material you give us to post.

---

## 3) How We Use Information

- To create, schedule, and publish content on your behalf on LinkedIn.
- To provide support, troubleshoot issues, and improve reliability.
- To comply with LinkedIn’s developer terms, our agreements, and applicable laws.
- To communicate with you about service updates and changes.

We do **not** sell your personal information.

---

## 4) Legal Bases (EEA/UK users)

Where GDPR/UK GDPR applies, our processing is based on:

- **Consent** (Art. 6(1)(a)) when you authorize our app via LinkedIn OAuth.
- **Contract** (Art. 6(1)(b)) to deliver services you request.
- **Legitimate interests** (Art. 6(1)(f)) for security, diagnostics, and service improvement, balanced against your rights and expectations.

---

## 5) Sharing & Disclosures

We may share data with **service providers/processors** who help us operate (e.g., cloud hosting, storage, logging). These providers are bound by contractual obligations to protect your information and use it only for our instructions. We may disclose information if required by law or to protect rights, safety, and integrity of our services.

---

## 6) Data Retention

- **Access tokens**: stored securely and kept only while valid or until you revoke access.
- **Posts and schedules**: retained as needed to provide the service or until you delete them or request deletion.
- **Operational logs**: retained for a limited period (typically up to 90 days) for diagnostics, then deleted or anonymized.

---

## 7) Security

We use reasonable technical and organizational measures, including encryption in transit, restricted access on a need‑to‑know basis, and secure secret storage. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure; we work to continually enhance our protections.

---

## 8) Your Choices & Rights

- **Revoke access** at any time from your LinkedIn account settings (Settings & Privacy → Data privacy → Other applications → Permitted services → Remove our app). You can also contact us to help.
- **Deletion requests**: Email us to request deletion of stored information associated with your account. We aim to respond within 30 days.
- **Access/Correction**: Contact us to access or correct your information.

---

## 9) International Transfers

If we transfer personal data across borders, we rely on appropriate safeguards (e.g., standard contractual clauses) as required by law.

---

## 10) Children’s Privacy

Our services are not intended for individuals under 16. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If you believe a child has provided us data, contact us to delete it.

---

## 11) Changes to this Policy

We may update this Policy periodically. We will revise the “Effective Date” when changes are made. Material changes will be notified through our usual communication channels.
